Install Python
Run `setup.bat` which downloads all the requirements

2. Setup Config
Fill out config.yaml, you can open this as a `.txt` file
Add watchlists as `.txt` files (1 ticker per line) inside the watchlists/ folder

Price < 10 and MACD > 0

Email (via Brevo)
Webhooks (like Discord)

Fully custom

No duplicates (triggered alerts auto-remove or mark)

## 🧬 DNA (Import/Export)

Export filters/alerts into readable DNA codes
ex: `ms:filter,a_cool_name,pc<1000,rsit<60,vm<0.5,mcc:100KK,fc:1KK,MACD:true`
Share or import setups easily through the UI

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Moon Sniper is alpha-stage software. This was built fast, ugly, but functional. Expect bugs. Expect weirdness. But it’s free forever, and it will evolve.
